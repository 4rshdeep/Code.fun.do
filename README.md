### Inspiring Lives.  
### From the people. For the people.  
Inspirata is a crowdsourced platform, which extracts motivating and encouraging tweets from Twitter and uses them to train a Markov Chain to produce encouraging words for those who might show signs of depression, suicide, anxiety etc.  

 **Updates** We used NLTK's part-of-speech tagger to generate a Markov model that obeys sentence structure better than a naive model.   
Responses generated by Inspirata can be seen [here](http://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~cs5160625/cfd.html) and also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_inspirata/with_replies) and program is running on a local server.

## Updates on Instabot
As an update to our platform, we extended our idea and added it to instagram, where we made a service which searches for certain keywords on instagram and then using our algorithms on images and caption comments with encouraging words.  


# Specs
We used Microsoft Text Analytics APIs for Natural Language Processing and then used a markov chain to produce sentences. We first use Language Detection to segregate tweets in English. Sentiment analysis then calculates positive or negative sentiment which is used to classify the tweet as sad or happy. If the tweet is a sad one, our app replies the person who tweeted with an inspiring qoute. If the tweet is a happy one, our app uses it to train the Markov chain model for generating inspiring quotes to tweet. In this sense, our app is a crowdsourced app. For Instagram we used the same algorithm but added additional feature to use an image for Emotion Detection that further enhances its functionality.

### We are not using any hardcoded quotes. All the quotes are generated through Markov Chain.
